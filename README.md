# General info
This is the machine learning part of our project BUSAHA which stand for "Buka dan Buat Usaha", BUSAHA will help people to identify which business is suitable for them through machine learning. 
This app might be able to predict the most likely business idea to succeed by looking at multiple variables such as store location, market, fund, and other factors that the user needs to fill.

This project using [Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) model using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), so far we've achieve 90% of training accuracy and 100% validation accuracy. The data contains 130+ samples with 17 classes with 20+ features. For spliting data and make string data into number we are using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and we using l2 normalization using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.normalize.html).

# Prerequisites
